# Cloud-based-risk-analyzer
This application provides a choice for the user to select the scalable service of their choice ( Choice is between lambda and EC2) to analyze the risks associated with a buy or sell signal of Tesla. It also provides an audit page that can be used to examine the time taken by each resource to calculate the risks.

This application needs to be updated with the latest cred file inorder to select the EC2 as the scalable service. This is because the application is developed in AWS academy.
